# 3D-TSNE
A Unity3D project for visualizing t-SNE data in 3D.

While it is possible create 3D visualizations of vector spaces natively in python, it is more difficult to animate
how a network learns to represent a dataset. This project allows for this dynamic visualization by taking a series of 
csv files generated from neural network representations at various stages in the model training process.

For more information on how to generate the csv files needed, see the following [post](https://medium.com/@awjuliani/visualizing-deep-learning-with-t-sne-tutorial-and-video-e7c59ee4080c#.z26oe1bnl)
